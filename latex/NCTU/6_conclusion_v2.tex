In this paper, we formulate the individual activity and mobility inference problem for personalized location-based service in location based social networks. We proposed the Bayesian based Activity Inference Model for user activity and mobility inference. We utilize Bayesian network to describe the relations among spatial, temporal and activity factors. There are two component in our Network Based Activity Inference Model, which are time-activity model and location-activity model. Instead of utilizing the traditional approach, which is non-negative matrix factorization, we propsed the activity transition model to closely capture the transition between user activities. On the other hand, we utilize the Gaussian Mixture Model to model user mobility, and compare with the Kernel Density estimation. We experiment on a real dataset called GeoText. Our personalize model outperform the state-of-art methods, which are NB, SVM, NMF,and CLAR for activity inference, and outperforms the KDE approach for mobility inference. With the experiment results, it shows that our activity inferrence model have average 70\% or more. Also the average log-likelihood of our mobility inference model is nearly 1. Therefore, NBAIM has good performances on both activity and mobility inference.
